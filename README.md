//Peer review: Great Job!!! The only bug I ran into was how the custom tip I can go down to negative -1 and so on. Then it acts wierd then total says Infinity when press the arrow down from zero. Does that same thing for the bill by the same thing I mean allowing me to put a negative number. Other than that it's responsive and does work just fine when I input regular numbers great work!!!
